# pyfolio
My own portfolio app using JSON as an input, Python Flask for backend, Jinja2 HTML template for processing the JSON input. And a bit of CSS with Flexboxes for the visuals and Javascript for interactivity.

To test/run the Flask app in Windows:
- cd into the pyfolio/pyfolio folder (using Command Prompt)
- Run the following commands:

    - ```set FLASK_APP=app.py```

    - ```flask run```

- Open the shown link in the browser.
